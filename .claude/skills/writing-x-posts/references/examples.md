## Single Posts

### Hot Take Post

```
Unpopular opinion:

The best time to start was 10 years ago.

The second best time is NOT today.

It's after you've actually thought through what you're starting and why.

"Just start" is lazy advice.
```

**Why it works**: Contrarian hook, challenges popular wisdom, makes reader think.

---

### Observation Post

```
I've noticed something about successful people:

They don't manage time. They manage energy.

They know when they're sharp and protect those hours ruthlessly.

Everything else gets the scraps.
```

**Why it works**: Simple observation, feels insightful, actionable implication.

---

### Quick Win Post

```
A negotiation trick that's worked every time:

When they make an offer, stay silent for 10 seconds.

Most people can't handle the pause.

They'll often improve the offer just to fill the silence.
```

**Why it works**: Specific technique, easy to try, immediate value.

---

### Reframe Post

```
Reframe:

You're not "bad at networking."

You're bad at pretending to care about people you don't care about.

Solution: Stop going to networking events. Start helping people you actually like.
```

**Why it works**: Validates reader's struggle, offers new perspective, actionable advice.

## Thread Examples

### Storytelling Thread

```
1/ I got fired on my birthday.

No warning. No severance. Just a box and a security escort.

Here's what happened next (and how it became the best thing for my career):

2/ Some context:

I'd been at the company for 3 years.
Good reviews. Promotions. Everything seemed fine.

Then new leadership came in and cleaned house.

I was out.

3/ The first week was brutal.

I applied to 50 jobs. Got 2 responses.
Both rejections.

I started questioning everything about my career.

4/ Then I did something different.

Instead of applying to more jobs, I reached out to 10 people I admired and asked one question:

"If you were starting over today, what would you do differently?"

5/ The responses changed everything.

8 out of 10 said some version of:

"I would have bet on myself sooner."

They'd all spent years building someone else's dream before building their own.

6/ That's when it clicked.

Getting fired wasn't a setback.
It was a forced decision I'd been too scared to make myself.

I had nothing to lose now.

7/ I started freelancing that month.

First client: $500.
By month 6: $10K/month.
By year 2: More than my old salary.

Getting fired gave me permission to try.

8/ The lesson:

Sometimes the worst thing that happens to you is actually the best thing.

You just can't see it yet.

If you're going through something hard right now—keep going.

What's a setback that turned into your biggest breakthrough?
```

**Why it works**:
- Hook creates immediate curiosity
- Story has clear arc (setup → conflict → resolution)
- Each tweet stands alone but builds narrative
- Universal lesson at the end
- Ends with engagement question

### Listicle Thread

```
1/ 7 harsh truths about career growth that nobody wants to hear:

(Save this—you'll need it)

2/ 1. Your work doesn't speak for itself.

Never has. Never will.

The people who get promoted are the ones who make their work visible.

Stop waiting to be discovered.

3/ 2. Your manager doesn't owe you mentorship.

They have their own job to do.

If you want mentorship, make it easy for them. Come with specific questions, not vague requests.

4/ 3. Being busy isn't the same as being valuable.

Nobody cares how many hours you worked.

They care about results.

Work less. Deliver more.

5/ 4. Your degree matters less every year you're out of school.

By year 5, nobody cares where you went to college.

They care what you've done since.

6/ 5. The best opportunities aren't posted.

They're created through relationships.

If you're only applying to job postings, you're competing with 500 other people.

7/ 6. Nobody is coming to save your career.

Not HR. Not your manager. Not the company.

You are the CEO of your own career.

Act like it.

8/ 7. Your "dream job" is probably a fantasy.

Every job has boring parts.

Stop looking for perfect. Start looking for growth.

Which one hit hardest? Reply with the number.
```

**Why it works**:
- Clear promise in hook
- Each tweet is standalone insight
- Consistent structure throughout
- "Save this" CTA early
- Engagement prompt at end

### Problem-Solution Thread

```
1/ Most people are terrible at cold emails.

Here's the exact template that got me a 40% response rate:

(Including the psychology behind why it works)

2/ First, why most cold emails fail:

- Too long
- Too much about you
- No clear ask
- Generic flattery

The reader thinks: "What do they want and why should I care?"

3/ The template (steal this):

Subject: [Specific thing you noticed about them]

[One sentence about what impressed you - be specific]

[One sentence about why you're reaching out]

[One clear, small ask]

[Your name]

That's it. 4-5 sentences max.

4/ Let's break down each part:

SUBJECT LINE:
Make it specific to them.

Bad: "Quick question"
Good: "Your thread on pricing strategy"

Specificity = they know you actually did your homework.

5/ THE OPENER:

One genuine, specific compliment.

Bad: "I love your content"
Good: "Your breakdown of the Amazon flywheel is the clearest explanation I've seen"

Specific > Generic. Always.

6/ THE REASON:

Why are you reaching out? Make it about THEM, not you.

Bad: "I'd love to pick your brain"
Good: "I'm working on a similar problem and think you might have insight"

7/ THE ASK:

Make it small and easy to say yes to.

Bad: "Can we hop on a 30-min call?"
Good: "Would you be open to a 2-question email exchange?"

Lower barrier = higher response rate.

8/ Real example that worked:

Subject: Your pricing experiment

Hey [Name],

Your thread on testing price elasticity was exactly what I needed. The spreadsheet framework was genius.

I'm running similar tests and hit a wall with sample size.

Would you be open to a quick email exchange? Just 2 questions.

Thanks,
[Me]

Response rate: 40%+

9/ Why this works:

1. Shows you paid attention (specific reference)
2. Shows you're doing the work (not just asking for free advice)
3. Makes saying yes easy (2 questions via email)

Respect their time. Be specific. Make it easy.

Save this for your next cold outreach.
```

**Why it works**:
- Specific promise with social proof (40% rate)
- Teaches the "why" not just the "what"
- Includes real example
- Each tweet adds new value
- Actionable and immediately usable

## Formatting Reminders

In all examples, notice:
- **Short sentences**: Easier to scan
- **White space**: Line breaks between thoughts
- **Numbered threads**: 1/, 2/, 3/ format
- **Cliffhangers**: Keep readers moving forward
- **Engagement ask**: End with question or save prompt
- **No hashtags cluttering**: 0-2 max, at end if used
