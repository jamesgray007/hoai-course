# Hook Patterns

The hook is the most critical part of any LinkedIn post. These first 2-3 lines appear before the "See more" button and determine whether readers engage or scroll past.

## Confession Hooks

Admit something unexpected. Vulnerability creates connection.

**Pattern**: "[Admission of failure/struggle/unpopular action]"

**Examples**:
- "I got rejected by Google. Twice."
- "I fired my best performer yesterday."
- "I've been lying on my resume for 10 years."
- "I turned down a $500K offer last week."
- "My first business failed in 3 months."
- "I cried in a meeting with my CEO."

**Why it works**: Breaks the "highlight reel" expectation. Readers lean in to understand how someone overcame or learned from the experience.

---

## Surprising Stat Hooks

Lead with a number that stops the scroll.

**Pattern**: "[Unexpected number] + [surprising context]"

**Examples**:
- "This one sentence made me $300K."
- "I interviewed 200 candidates. Only 3 got hired."
- "93% of my revenue comes from one skill."
- "I read 100 leadership books. Here's the only advice that mattered."
- "7 words changed my entire career trajectory."
- "I spent $50K on courses. This free lesson taught me more."

**Why it works**: Numbers create specificity and credibility. The contrast between the number and outcome creates intrigue.

---

## Contrarian Hooks

Challenge widely-held beliefs.

**Pattern**: "[Common belief] is wrong/dead/overrated"

**Examples**:
- "Hustle culture is killing your career."
- "Your passion won't pay the bills."
- "Networking events are a waste of time."
- "The 'dream job' is a myth."
- "Being busy is not the same as being productive."
- "Your resume doesn't matter anymore."
- "Stop following your passion. Seriously."

**Why it works**: Triggers cognitive dissonance. Readers need to understand why their belief might be wrong.

---

## Curiosity Gap Hooks

Tease information without revealing it.

**Pattern**: "[Person/situation] + [intriguing action] + [incomplete information]"

**Examples**:
- "The CEO pulled me aside and said 3 words."
- "My mentor gave me advice that sounded crazy at the time."
- "There's one question I ask every candidate. Most fail."
- "I noticed something strange in every successful founder I met."
- "The worst career advice I ever followed? It changed everything."
- "She said one thing in the interview that got her the job."

**Why it works**: The brain craves closure. Incomplete information compels readers to click "See more."

---

## Direct Value Hooks

Promise immediate, specific benefit.

**Pattern**: "Here's [exactly/how/the] [specific outcome]"

**Examples**:
- "Here's exactly how I grew my network by 10x."
- "The exact email template that landed me 50 clients."
- "How I went from $0 to $100K in 12 months (step by step)."
- "The framework I use to make every decision."
- "5 scripts that made hard conversations easy."
- "The morning routine that 10x'd my productivity."

**Why it works**: Clear value proposition. Readers know exactly what they'll get.

---

## Question Hooks

Open with a provocative question.

**Pattern**: "[Question that challenges or resonates]?"

**Examples**:
- "What if everything you know about productivity is wrong?"
- "Are you building a career or just collecting titles?"
- "Why do smart people make terrible decisions?"
- "What's the one skill no one talks about?"
- "Would you rather be rich or respected?"
- "How many opportunities have you missed because you were 'too busy'?"

**Why it works**: Questions activate the brain differently. Readers naturally seek to answer.

---

## Pattern Interrupt Hooks

Start with something unexpected that breaks scrolling patterns.

**Pattern**: [Short, punchy statement that seems incomplete or unusual]

**Examples**:
- "I quit."
- "Plot twist."
- "Unpopular opinion incoming."
- "This will be controversial."
- "Nobody talks about this."
- "True story."
- "Read this twice."

**Why it works**: The brevity and incompleteness creates a "wait, what?" moment.

---

## Transformation Hooks

Show before/after contrast.

**Pattern**: "[Past state] → [Current state]"

**Examples**:
- "From burnout to my best year ever."
- "I went from 0 followers to 50K in 6 months."
- "Broke at 25. Built a 7-figure company by 30."
- "Rejected by 100 companies. Now I run one."
- "Anxious people-pleaser to confident leader."
- "From 80-hour weeks to working 4 days."

**Why it works**: Transformation stories are inherently compelling. Readers want to know the journey.

## Hook Testing Framework

When crafting hooks, test against these criteria:

1. **Scroll-stop**: Would this make you pause mid-scroll?
2. **Curiosity**: Does it create an information gap?
3. **Relevance**: Does it connect to your target audience's interests?
4. **Authenticity**: Can you actually deliver on this hook?
5. **Specificity**: Is it concrete rather than vague?

**Weak hook**: "Here are some tips for success."
**Strong hook**: "I failed 17 times before finding the one strategy that worked."

The difference: specificity, vulnerability, and a clear curiosity gap.
