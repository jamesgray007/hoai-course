# Hook Patterns

The hook is the most critical part of any LinkedIn post. These first 2-3 lines appear before the "See more" button and determine whether readers engage or scroll past.

## The Evolution of LinkedIn Hooks

LinkedIn audiences have grown sophisticated. What worked in 2020 often feels manipulative now. The best hooks in 2024-2025 feel genuine—they create curiosity without feeling engineered.

**The shift**: From manufactured curiosity gaps → Honest, specific openings

## Honest Admission Hooks

Admit something real. Not performed vulnerability—genuine acknowledgment of a change in thinking, a mistake, or a limitation.

**Pattern**: "[I was wrong / I've changed my mind / I used to believe] + [specific thing]"

**Examples**:
- "I've been wrong about remote work."
- "I used to give terrible feedback. Here's what changed."
- "I spent three years optimizing for the wrong metric."
- "I dismissed this advice for a decade. I regret it."
- "My first instinct on this was completely backwards."
- "I finally understand why my team was frustrated."

**Why it works**: Shows intellectual honesty and growth. Readers trust people who can admit mistakes.

**What makes it authentic**: The admission is specific, not vague. You're sharing what you learned, not just confessing for sympathy.

---

## Specific Observation Hooks

Share something you've noticed with enough specificity that it signals real experience.

**Pattern**: "[I've noticed/seen/observed] + [specific pattern] + [in specific context]"

**Examples**:
- "I've noticed something in every founder who scaled past $10M."
- "After 200 interviews, one pattern keeps appearing."
- "The best managers I've worked with all do this differently."
- "I've watched 15 product launches this year. The failures share one thing."
- "Something strange happens when companies hit 50 employees."
- "Every successful negotiation I've seen starts the same way."

**Why it works**: Specificity creates credibility. Numbers and contexts signal real experience, not theoretical advice.

**What makes it authentic**: You've actually observed this. You can back it up with examples if asked.

---

## Direct Challenge Hooks

Challenge a common belief or practice directly. No hedge, no apology.

**Pattern**: "[Common practice/belief] + [is wrong/doesn't work/misses the point]"

**Examples**:
- "Most career advice optimizes for the wrong thing."
- "Your company's values statement is probably useless."
- "We've been thinking about productivity backwards."
- "The 'ideal candidate' doesn't exist. Stop looking."
- "Most feedback is actually just judgment in disguise."
- "Your morning routine isn't why you're successful."

**Why it works**: Creates productive tension. Readers want to understand why you disagree with conventional wisdom.

**What makes it authentic**: You have a real alternative to offer. You're not just contrarian for engagement—you've thought this through.

---

## Unexpected Angle Hooks

Subvert expectations by taking a familiar topic in an unfamiliar direction.

**Pattern**: "[Surprising outcome] + [from unexpected source/approach]"

**Examples**:
- "The best hire I ever made had the worst resume."
- "My biggest career win came from saying no."
- "The meeting that changed everything lasted 4 minutes."
- "I learned more from my worst boss than my best one."
- "The strategy that worked was the one I almost didn't try."
- "My most successful project started as a joke."

**Why it works**: Subverts the expected narrative. Readers lean in to understand the disconnect.

**What makes it authentic**: This actually happened. The story delivers on the hook's promise.

---

## Simple Truth Hooks

State something true that people feel but rarely say out loud.

**Pattern**: "[Uncomfortable/unspoken truth about shared experience]"

**Examples**:
- "Nobody talks about how lonely leadership is."
- "Most people hate their jobs. We just don't say it at work."
- "Networking feels fake because most of it is."
- "The 'dream job' often isn't."
- "Everyone's winging it. The confident ones are just better actors."
- "Burnout doesn't announce itself. It arrives quietly."

**Why it works**: Resonates emotionally. Readers feel seen when someone names what they've been thinking.

**What makes it authentic**: You're sharing genuine insight, not manufactured profundity. This comes from real observation.

---

## Question Hooks

Open with a question that makes readers stop and reflect.

**Pattern**: "[Provocative question that challenges or resonates]?"

**Examples**:
- "What if your biggest weakness is actually protecting you?"
- "When did 'busy' become a badge of honor?"
- "Are you building a career or just collecting jobs?"
- "What would you do if you weren't afraid of looking stupid?"
- "How many opportunities have you missed by 'waiting for the right time'?"
- "What's the decision you keep postponing?"

**Why it works**: Questions activate the brain differently. Readers naturally pause to consider their answer.

**What makes it authentic**: The question is genuine—you're actually curious about people's answers, not just using it as a device.

---

## Transformation Hooks

Show genuine before/after contrast with specific detail.

**Pattern**: "[Specific past state] → [Specific current state]"

**Examples**:
- "From 'I'll never be a manager' to leading a team of 40."
- "Burned out at 28. Running a company at 32."
- "Rejected by every firm I applied to. Now I run one."
- "Couldn't write a sentence without second-guessing. Now I write daily."
- "Terrified of public speaking. Just gave my first keynote."
- "From dreading Mondays to actually looking forward to work."

**Why it works**: Transformation stories are inherently compelling. Readers want to know what changed.

**What makes it authentic**: The transformation is real and recent enough to remember the journey. You can describe specific turning points.

## Hooks to Retire

These patterns have been overused to the point of triggering skepticism:

| Tired Hook | Why It's Tired | Better Alternative |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| "This one thing made me $300K" | Feels like a scam ad | "Here's what actually moved the needle for my business" |
| "The CEO pulled me aside and said 3 words" | Manufactured suspense | "My CEO said something I didn't understand until years later" |
| "I'm excited to announce..." | Corporate speak | Just announce the thing directly |
| "X words that changed my life" | Too formulaic | Tell the actual story |
| "A stranger approached me at [airport/coffee shop]" | Overused format | Share the insight without the manufactured setting |
| "You won't believe what happened next" | Clickbait energy | Let the story speak for itself |
| "Here's why you're doing [X] wrong" | Preachy and presumptuous | "I used to do [X] this way. Here's what I changed." |
| "Stop doing [X]. Start doing [Y]." | Commands don't build connection | "What worked better for me was..." |

## Hook Testing Framework

When crafting hooks, test against these criteria:

1. **Scroll-stop**: Would this make YOU pause mid-scroll?
2. **Authenticity**: Can you actually deliver on this hook?
3. **Specificity**: Is it concrete rather than vague?
4. **Earned**: Do you have the experience to back this up?
5. **Non-manipulative**: Does it feel honest or engineered?

### Weak vs. Strong Examples

| Weak | Strong | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| "Here are some tips for success" | "Three things I wish I'd known at 25" | Specific, personal, implies story |
| "You need to hear this" | "This took me years to figure out" | Positions as sharing vs. lecturing |
| "The secret to productivity" | "I tried every productivity system. Only one stuck." | Experience-based, not prescriptive |
| "Everyone should know this" | "I learned this the hard way" | Humble, story-driven |

---

## The Authenticity Test

Before using any hook, ask:

1. Did this actually happen / do I actually believe this?
2. Would I say this in a real conversation?
3. Does the post deliver on what the hook promises?
4. Will I be proud of this hook in a year?

The best hooks don't feel like hooks. They feel like the natural start of something you genuinely want to share.
