# LinkedIn Post Writer

Create engaging, authentic LinkedIn posts that drive meaningful engagement and establish thought leadership.

## Core Principles

### Authenticity Over Perfection
LinkedIn rewards genuine voices. Share real experiences, admit failures, and provide honest insights. Readers connect with humans, not polished corporate messaging.

### One Idea Per Post
The biggest mistake is cramming multiple tips, stories, or angles into one post. Focus on:
- One core idea
- One story
- One insight
- One lesson

### Value First
Every post must educate, inspire, or entertain. Ask: "What will the reader gain from this?"

## Post Anatomy

### The Hook (Lines 1-2)
The first 2-3 lines determine everything—they appear before "See more" and decide if readers engage or scroll past.

**Hook patterns** (see `references/hooks.md` for complete list with examples):
- **Confession**: "I got rejected by Google. Twice."
- **Surprising stat**: "This one sentence made me $300K."
- **Contrarian take**: "Hustle culture is killing your career."
- **Curiosity gap**: "The CEO pulled me aside and said 3 words."
- **Direct value**: "Here's exactly how I grew my network by 10x."

### The Body
Structure for scannability:
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences max)
- Line breaks between thoughts
- Bullet points for lists
- Bold for emphasis on key phrases

**Storytelling framework**:
1. Set the scene (briefly)
2. Introduce the conflict/challenge
3. Show the journey/transformation
4. Deliver the insight/lesson
5. Make it applicable to the reader

### The Close
End with purpose:
- **Question**: Invite discussion ("What's your experience with this?")
- **Call to action**: Guide next step ("Save this for your next interview")
- **Reflection prompt**: Encourage thinking ("Which one resonates most?")

## Writing Guidelines

### Tone
- Conversational, not corporate
- Confident, not arrogant
- Helpful, not salesy
- Personal, not generic

### Length
- Optimal: 150-300 words
- Maximum: 3,000 characters
- Use whitespace generously

### Formatting Rules
- Never use hashtags inline with text
- Place 3-5 hashtags at the very end, after a line break
- Avoid excessive emoji (1-2 max, if any)
- Use "I" not "we" for personal posts

### What to Avoid
- Starting with "I'm excited to announce..."
- Humblebrags without genuine insight
- Corporate jargon and buzzwords
- Asking for engagement without providing value
- Generic motivational quotes without personal context

## Content Categories That Perform

1. **Career lessons** - Failures, pivots, growth moments
2. **Behind-the-scenes** - Real work experiences, decisions made
3. **Industry insights** - Trends, observations, predictions
4. **How-to frameworks** - Actionable processes readers can use
5. **Contrarian takes** - Challenge assumptions (with substance)
6. **Personal milestones** - Tied to broader lessons
