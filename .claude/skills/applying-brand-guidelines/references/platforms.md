---

## LinkedIn

### Platform Context
- Professional audience seeking career/business value
- Algorithm rewards early engagement (first 60-90 minutes)
- Content appears in feed with "See more" truncation after ~3 lines

### Content Specifications
- **Length**: 150-300 words optimal, max 3,000 characters
- **Format**: Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences), generous whitespace
- **Hashtags**: 3-5 at the very end, never inline
- **Links**: Place in comments (links in post reduce reach)
- **Media**: Images/carousels increase engagement

### Voice Adaptation
- Lean slightly more **professional** on the formality scale
- Maintain **authoritative** positioning
- Keep **accessible** even when technical
- Balance confidence with humility

### Structure Pattern
```
[Hook - 2-3 compelling lines]

[Context or story setup]

[Main insight/content]

[Takeaway or lesson]

[Engaging question or CTA]

#relevant #hashtags #here
```

### Best Practices
- First 2-3 lines must hook (appears before "See more")
- One idea per post
- Use line breaks between thoughts
- End with question to drive comments
- Post Tuesday-Thursday, 8-11am in audience timezone

### Avoid
- "I'm excited to announce..."
- Wall of text without breaks
- Multiple ideas crammed together
- Hashtags scattered throughout
- Salesy or promotional tone

---

## Substack

### Platform Context
- Subscribers chose to receive your content
- Long-form reading environment
- Direct relationship with audience
- Email delivery means different reading context

### Content Specifications
- **Length**: 500-2,000 words typical (can go longer)
- **Format**: Headers, sections, clear structure
- **Hashtags**: Not used
- **Links**: Encouraged, readers expect depth
- **Media**: Images, charts support narrative

### Voice Adaptation
- Lean more **personal** and **conversational**
- Can be more **in-depth** and nuanced
- Show more personality and opinion
- More room for **storytelling**

### Structure Pattern
```
[Compelling headline]

[Opening hook or personal anecdote]

## Section 1
[Expand on first point]

## Section 2
[Expand on second point]

## Section 3
[Expand on third point]

[Conclusion with personal reflection]

[Call to action - subscribe, share, reply]
```

### Best Practices
- Treat it like a letter to a smart friend
- Go deeper than surface-level takes
- Include your genuine perspective
- Use headers for scannability
- Personal stories build connection
- Ask readers to reply (builds relationship)

### Avoid
- Corporate/sterile tone
- Clickbait without substance
- Pure information without perspective
- Forgetting the human on the other end

## X (Twitter)

### Platform Context
- Fast-moving feed, short attention spans
- Conversational and real-time
- Engagement drives reach
- Thread format for longer content

### Content Specifications
- **Length**: 280 characters per post, threads for more
- **Format**: Punchy, complete thoughts
- **Hashtags**: 1-2 maximum, integrated naturally
- **Links**: Can reduce reach, use strategically
- **Media**: Images/video increase engagement

### Voice Adaptation
- Lean **casual** and **conversational**
- More **punchy** and direct
- Can be more **playful** if brand allows
- **Concise** is essential

### Single Post Pattern
```
[One complete thought or observation]

[Optional: single hashtag]
```

### Thread Pattern
```
1/ [Hook - the promise of the thread]

2/ [First point]

3/ [Second point]

4/ [Third point]

5/ [Conclusion or call to action]
```

### Best Practices
- One idea per tweet
- Front-load the value
- Use threads for complex topics
- Engage in replies (builds community)
- Retweet with commentary adds value
- Timing matters less than consistency

### Avoid
- Trying to say too much in one tweet
- Thread hooks that don't deliver
- Excessive hashtags
- Pure self-promotion
- Ignoring replies

## Cross-Platform Adaptation

### Same Topic, Different Formats

**Example topic**: "Lessons from a failed product launch"

**LinkedIn version** (full post):
```
We killed our product last month.

6 months of work. $50K invested. Zero traction.

Here's what went wrong:

We built what we thought was brilliant.
We never asked if anyone actually wanted it.

The market gave us the answer we should have sought earlier.

Lesson learned: Fall in love with the problem, not your solution.

What's a product failure that taught you something valuable?

#productmanagement #startups #lessons
```

**Substack version** (newsletter intro):
```
Last month, we made the call to shut down a product we'd spent
six months building.

It wasn't easy. But looking back, the signs were there from the
beginning—we just didn't want to see them.

In this week's newsletter, I'm breaking down exactly what went
wrong, what we missed, and the framework I'm now using to
validate ideas before committing resources...
```

**X version** (thread):
```
1/ We just killed a product we spent 6 months building.

Here's what went wrong (and what I'd do differently):

2/ Mistake #1: We built in isolation.

6 months of heads-down development.
Zero customer conversations.

3/ Mistake #2: We fell in love with our solution.

The tech was elegant.
The problem it solved? Nobody had it.

4/ Mistake #3: We ignored early signals.

Beta users were polite, not excited.
Polite ≠ product-market fit.

5/ The fix: Fall in love with problems, not solutions.

Now I talk to 10 potential users before writing a line of code.
```

### Adaptation Checklist

When adapting content across platforms:

1. **Preserve core message** - The insight stays the same
2. **Adjust depth** - LinkedIn (medium), Substack (deep), X (surface)
3. **Match format expectations** - Each platform has norms
4. **Shift tone slightly** - Professional → Personal → Casual
5. **Change CTA** - Platform-appropriate action
6. **Maintain voice** - Brand personality stays consistent
