## Story Openers

Start in the middle of a moment. Most viral Notes open with story, not advice.

**Pattern**: [Specific moment or scene that drops reader into action]

**Examples**:
- "I was halfway through my coffee when it hit me."
- "Someone asked me a question yesterday that I can't stop thinking about."
- "I almost deleted this before posting."
- "Three years ago, I would have disagreed with what I'm about to say."
- "My mentor told me something that made no sense at the time."

**Why it works**: Story creates immediate emotional engagement. Readers want to know what happens.

## Observation Hooks

Share something you've noticed. Fresh perspective on everyday experiences.

**Pattern**: [I've noticed/I realized/Something I've been thinking about] + [specific observation]

**Examples**:
- "I've noticed that the most productive people I know rarely talk about productivity."
- "Something I've been thinking about: the best conversations happen when nobody's trying to be impressive."
- "A pattern I keep seeing: people wait for permission they don't actually need."
- "The older I get, the more I realize that most advice is autobiography."
- "I've started paying attention to what makes me feel energized vs. depleted."

**Why it works**: Observations feel genuine and invite others to share their own.

## Contrarian Hooks

Challenge what everyone believes. These get 3-4x more engagement than standard advice.

**Pattern**: [Popular belief/common advice] + [why you disagree or see it differently]

**Examples**:
- "Hot take: 'follow your passion' is advice that only works if you're already privileged."
- "Unpopular opinion: networking events are mostly useless."
- "I'm starting to think hustle culture isn't the problem. Lack of direction is."
- "What if 'imposter syndrome' is just accurate self-assessment?"
- "Maybe the goal isn't to be more productive. Maybe it's to need less."

**Why it works**: Challenges create cognitive tension. Readers need to engage to resolve it.

---

## Question Hooks

Genuine questions that invite real responses. Not rhetorical—actually curious.

**Pattern**: [Question you're genuinely wrestling with]

**Examples**:
- "Honest question: how do you know when to quit vs. when to push through?"
- "I'm curious—what's a belief you held strongly 5 years ago that you've completely changed?"
- "What's something you wish someone had told you earlier in your career?"
- "How do you balance ambition with contentment?"
- "When's the last time you changed your mind about something important?"

**Why it works**: Questions invite participation. People love sharing their perspective.

---

## Confession Hooks

Admit something vulnerable or counterintuitive. Authenticity builds trust.

**Pattern**: [Honest admission that goes against your "brand" or expected persona]

**Examples**:
- "I'll be honest: I don't have this figured out."
- "Something I don't talk about much: I almost quit last year."
- "Confession: I give advice I don't always follow myself."
- "I used to think I needed to have all the answers. I don't."
- "Here's what I got wrong about [topic]."

**Why it works**: Vulnerability stands out in a sea of polished content. People connect with honesty.

---

## Reframe Hooks

Take a familiar concept and present it differently.

**Pattern**: [Common understanding] → [New way to see it]

**Examples**:
- "Procrastination isn't laziness. It's fear wearing a different mask."
- "Maybe writer's block isn't a block. Maybe it's your brain asking for more input."
- "What if 'being stuck' is just the feeling of growth before it becomes visible?"
- "Burnout isn't about working too hard. It's about working on the wrong things."
- "Rejection isn't failure. It's information."

**Why it works**: Reframes make people see familiar things differently. That's valuable.

## Hooks to Avoid

**Generic advice openers**:
- ❌ "Here are 5 tips for..."
- ❌ "Want to be more productive? Try this..."
- ❌ "The secret to success is..."

**Bot-like patterns**:
- ❌ "In today's fast-paced world..."
- ❌ "As a [professional], I..."
- ❌ "Let me share some insights about..."

**Engagement bait without substance**:
- ❌ "Agree or disagree?"
- ❌ "Comment below if..."
- ❌ "Who else feels this way?"

## Hook Testing

Before posting, ask:

1. **Would I stop scrolling for this?**
2. **Does it sound like a real person?**
3. **Is there something to respond to?**
4. **Am I starting with story/observation, not advice?**
5. **Would I want to read what comes after this?**

**Weak**: "Here's what I've learned about productivity."
**Strong**: "I used to wake up at 5am every day. Then I realized I was just running from something."
