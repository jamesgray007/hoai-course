## Short Wisdom Notes

One insight in 1-3 lines. ~30-50 words.

### Example 1

```
The best career advice I ever got:

"Stop trying to be interesting. Start being interested."

Took me a decade to actually understand what that meant.
```

**Why it works**: Personal attribution, quotable insight, vulnerability in the last line.

---

### Example 2

```
Most advice is autobiography disguised as universal truth.

The person telling you "the right way" is usually just telling you what worked for them.

Doesn't mean it'll work for you.
```

**Why it works**: Reframe that makes reader reconsider how they consume advice.

---

### Example 3

```
Productivity isn't about doing more.

It's about knowing what not to do.

The hard part isn't adding things to your life. It's removing them.
```

**Why it works**: Contrarian take on popular topic, builds to a clear point.

---

## Micro-Story Notes

Brief anecdote building to one insight. ~80-150 words.

### Example 1

```
Someone asked me yesterday what I'd do differently if I could start my career over.

I said: "I'd stop asking for permission."

Not permission from bosses. Permission from myself.

I spent years waiting until I felt "ready." Until I had the right credentials. Until someone told me I could.

Turns out, nobody was going to give me that permission. The people who seemed to have it? They just decided to start.

What are you waiting for permission to do?
```

**Why it works**: Opens with specific moment, builds to universal insight, ends with engaging question.

---

### Example 2

```
I almost sent an angry email last night.

I'd written it, re-read it three times, and had my cursor hovering over send.

Then I closed my laptop and went to bed instead.

This morning I read it again. Deleted the whole thing.

The version I would have sent was technically "right." But it would have made everything worse.

Sometimes the most powerful thing you can do is nothing.
```

**Why it works**: Relatable scenario, tension, universal lesson that readers can apply.

---

### Example 3

```
My mentor told me something ten years ago that I completely dismissed.

"You're not as important as you think you are."

I was offended. I thought she was putting me down.

Now I understand what she meant:

Nobody's paying as much attention to your failures as you are. Nobody's tracking your mistakes. You're not the main character in anyone else's story.

That's actually the most freeing thing I've ever learned.
```

**Why it works**: Story arc with twist, insight that reframes what seemed negative.

---

## Question/Invitation Notes

Genuine questions that spark conversation. ~30-60 words.

### Example 1

```
Honest question I've been sitting with:

How do you know when to quit something vs. when to push through?

I've made both mistakes—quit too early, stayed too long.

Still don't have a good framework for this. What's worked for you?
```

**Why it works**: Admits uncertainty, invites real responses, not rhetorical.

---

### Example 2

```
What's something you believed strongly 5 years ago that you've completely changed your mind about?

I'll go first: I used to think working more hours = more output.

Now I know that's completely backwards.

What about you?
```

**Why it works**: Goes first with own answer, makes it easy for others to respond.

---

### Example 3

```
I'm curious—what's a piece of "common wisdom" in your field that you think is actually wrong?

Every industry has these. Rules that everyone follows but nobody questions.

What's yours?
```

**Why it works**: Industry-specific but universally applicable, invites expertise sharing.

---

## Contrarian Notes

Challenge conventional wisdom. ~50-100 words.

### Example 1

```
Unpopular opinion:

"Follow your passion" is advice that mostly works for privileged people.

If you have bills to pay and mouths to feed, "passion" is a luxury.

Better advice: Get good at something valuable. Passion often follows mastery.

You don't have to love your work to build a good life.
```

**Why it works**: Directly challenges popular advice, offers alternative, acknowledges nuance.

---

### Example 2

```
Hot take: Most networking is a waste of time.

Collecting business cards from strangers you'll never talk to again isn't networking.

Real networking:
- Help people without expecting anything back
- Stay in touch with 10 people who matter
- Be known for one thing

Depth > breadth.
```

**Why it works**: Bold opening, specific alternative, actionable reframe.

---

### Example 3

```
What if "imposter syndrome" isn't a syndrome at all?

What if it's just... accurate self-assessment?

Maybe feeling like you don't know everything is the correct response to being in a room full of smart people.

Maybe the people who never feel like imposters are the ones we should worry about.
```

**Why it works**: Reframes a common struggle, makes reader feel seen rather than broken.

---

## Behind-the-Scenes Notes

Share your process or creative journey. ~60-100 words.

### Example 1

```
Sharing something I don't usually talk about:

My first 20 posts got almost zero engagement.

I almost quit after post #15. Felt like I was shouting into a void.

Post #23 was the first one that actually connected.

If you're early and feeling invisible: that's normal. The people who make it look easy just started before you did.

Keep going.
```

**Why it works**: Vulnerable, specific numbers, encouragement for others in same position.

---

### Example 2

```
Behind the scenes of today's newsletter:

Draft 1: Too long, deleted half
Draft 2: Too short, felt incomplete
Draft 3: Realized I was trying to say two things at once
Draft 4: Cut to one idea, finally worked

Writing looks effortless when you only see the final version.

It's not.
```

**Why it works**: Shows messy reality, makes others feel normal about their own struggles.

---

### Example 3

```
Something I'm working through right now:

I keep saying yes to things I should say no to.

Not because I want to do them. Because I'm afraid of disappointing people.

I don't have a solution yet. Just noticing the pattern.

Anyone else deal with this?
```

**Why it works**: Real-time vulnerability, invites community support, no false resolution.

---

## Restack with Commentary

Share others' content with your perspective. ~30-50 words of your own.

### Example 1

```
[Restacking someone's Note about writing daily]

This resonates.

I used to think I needed inspiration to write. Now I know writing creates the inspiration.

The muse shows up after you start, not before.
```

**Why it works**: Adds personal experience to someone else's insight, extends the conversation.

---

### Example 2

```
[Restacking someone's Note about career pivots]

Made a similar pivot three years ago.

Best decision I ever made—but it didn't feel that way at the time. It felt terrifying.

If you're considering a change and it scares you, that might be a good sign.
```

**Why it works**: Personal proof point, encouragement for others considering same move.

---

## Formatting Reminders

Across all examples, notice:

- **Short paragraphs**: 1-2 sentences max
- **White space**: Line breaks between thoughts
- **Word count**: Most are under 100 words
- **First line**: Hooks immediately, no throat-clearing
- **Last line**: Often a question or invitation
- **Tone**: Conversational, honest, human
- **No hashtags**: Notes don't use them
