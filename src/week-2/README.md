# Week 2: AI Workflows with Assistants and No-Code Platforms

## Overview
This week bridges the gap between prompt engineering and coding by exploring no-code and low-code platforms for building AI workflows. You'll learn to create automated workflows that connect AI assistants with other tools and services.

## Learning Objectives
- Design multi-step AI workflows without coding
- Use OpenAI Assistants API through no-code interfaces
- Connect AI to external tools and services
- Build automated workflows for real business processes
- Understand workflow patterns and best practices
- Create production-ready automations

## Prerequisites
- Completed Week 1 (Prompt engineering fundamentals)
- OpenAI API key (for Assistants API)
- Access to no-code platforms (recommendations below)
- Understanding of basic workflow concepts

## Week 2 Structure

### Workflow Examples (`workflows-assistants/`)

#### **marketing-campaign.md**
Complete marketing campaign automation workflow example.

**What it demonstrates:**
- Multi-step workflow design
- AI assistant integration
- Content generation pipeline
- Quality control checkpoints
- Distribution automation

**Workflow Overview:**
```
1. Campaign Brief → AI Analysis
2. Content Generation → Multiple formats
3. Review and Refinement → Quality checks
4. Scheduling and Distribution → Multi-channel
5. Performance Tracking → Analytics
```

## Key Concepts

### 1. Workflow vs. Single Prompt

**Single Prompt:**
```
"Create a marketing campaign for our product"
→ One-shot, limited control, generic output
```

**Workflow:**
```
Step 1: Analyze product and audience → insights
Step 2: Generate campaign strategy → plan
Step 3: Create content variants → drafts
Step 4: Refine based on criteria → polished content
Step 5: Format for channels → ready to publish
```

**Benefits:**
- More control at each step
- Better quality through iteration
- Easier to debug and improve
- Reproducible results
- Can integrate with other tools

### 2. Workflow Patterns

#### **Sequential Pattern**
```
A → B → C → D
```
Each step depends on previous step's output.

**Example:** Research → Draft → Edit → Publish

#### **Parallel Pattern**
```
      ┌→ B1 ┐
A → ┼→ B2 ┼→ C
      └→ B3 ┘
```
Multiple operations happen simultaneously.

**Example:** Generate blog post, social posts, and email simultaneously from brief

#### **Conditional Pattern**
```
A → Decision → B (if yes)
            → C (if no)
```
Path depends on evaluation.

**Example:** Content review → Publish (if approved) or Revise (if rejected)

#### **Loop Pattern**
```
A → B → Check → (back to A if needed) → C
```
Repeat until criteria met.

**Example:** Generate → Review → Improve → Review → Done

### 3. OpenAI Assistants API

The Assistants API enables persistent conversations with tools and files.

**Key Features:**
- **Threads**: Persistent conversation history
- **Tools**: Web search, file search, code interpreter, functions
- **Files**: Upload and reference documents
- **Instructions**: System-level guidance

**Workflow Benefits:**
- Maintains context across steps
- Can access knowledge bases
- Supports complex tool usage
- Structured output formats

- Open source option
- Self-hostable
- Extensive integrations
- Developer-friendly

**VectorShift** (vectorshift.ai)

## Best Practices

### Workflow Design

✅ **Do:**
- Start simple, add complexity gradually
- Include error handling
- Add human review for critical decisions
- Log important events
- Test thoroughly before production
- Document your workflows
- Monitor performance and costs

❌ **Don't:**
- Build overly complex workflows initially
- Forget about error cases
- Automate without human oversight for important tasks
- Ignore API rate limits
- Skip testing phases
- Forget to version control configurations

### AI Integration

**Prompt Design for Workflows:**
```
System: You are step [N] in a [workflow type] workflow
Previous context: [output from previous step]
Current task: [specific task]
Output format: [exact format needed for next step]
Constraints: [any limitations]
```

**Error Handling:**
```
If AI output is unclear:
→ Retry with refined prompt
→ Alert human reviewer
→ Log for improvement

If API fails:
→ Retry with exponential backoff
→ Fall back to alternative method
→ Notify administrators
```

### Performance Optimization

- **Batch operations** where possible
- **Cache results** for repeated queries
- **Use webhooks** instead of polling
- **Parallel processing** for independent steps
- **Monitor API costs** and usage

## Common Patterns and Templates

### Pattern 1: Input → Process → Output
```
1. Receive input (form, email, etc.)
2. AI processes input
3. Deliver output (email, database, etc.)
```

### Pattern 2: Monitor → Analyze → Act
```
1. Monitor for events/changes
2. AI analyzes significance
3. Take appropriate action
```

### Pattern 3: Generate → Review → Refine
```
1. AI generates content
2. Evaluate quality
3. AI refines based on feedback
4. Repeat until satisfactory
```

### Pattern 4: Collect → Synthesize → Report
```
1. Gather data from multiple sources
2. AI synthesizes information
3. Generate and distribute report
```
