Create a customer intelligence agent that:
1. Analyze feedback from [specify sources: product reviews, support tickets, social media, user forums]:
   - Aggregate feedback from [time period: past 30/60/90 days]
   - Focus on [product/service area if specific]
   - Minimum threshold: themes mentioned 50+ times
2. Extract common themes and pain points:
   - Categorize by type: functionality, usability, performance, support, pricing
   - Quantify frequency and severity of each theme
   - Identify trends (increasing, stable, decreasing mentions)
   - Note correlations between themes
3. Prioritize feature requests by:
   - Frequency: Number of customer mentions
   - Business impact: Revenue at risk or opportunity size
   - Competitive context: Features competitors have that we lack
   - Implementation complexity: Estimated effort (T-shirt sizing: S/M/L)
4. Generate product intelligence report with:
   - Executive summary (3-4 sentences highlighting key findings)
   - Customer sentiment overview:
     * Overall satisfaction trend
     * Top positive themes
     * Top pain points
   - Top 5 customer pain points:
     * Pain Point 1:
       - Description and business impact
       - Frequency: [number] mentions
       - Verbatim examples (2-3 representative quotes)
       - Severity: [High/Medium/Low]
       - Trend: [Increasing/Stable/Decreasing]
     * [Repeat for points 2-5]
   - Recommended feature priorities:
     * Priority 1: [Feature name]
       - Customer need being addressed
       - Frequency: [number] requests
       - Estimated ROI: [revenue opportunity or churn reduction]
       - Implementation complexity: [S/M/L]
       - Recommended timeline: [Quarter/Year]
     * [Repeat for priorities 2-5]
   - Competitive feature gap analysis:
     * Features competitors have that we lack
     * Customer impact of these gaps
     * Strategic importance of closing gaps
   - Appendix: Data sources and methodology
5. Save output to customer-intelligence-[product-area]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md
