# Audit Your Workflow for AI Opportunities

## What You'll Do in This Lesson

You'll complete a systematic audit of your workflows to identify where AI can reclaim 5-10 hours of your week. This isn't about finding trendy AI use cases—it's about discovering YOUR specific high-impact opportunities.

**By the end of this exercise, you'll have:**
- ✅ A scored inventory of your recurring workflows
- ✅ Your Top 3 AI opportunities ranked by impact
- ✅ Clear understanding of where to focus your AI implementation efforts

**Time commitment:** 20-25 minutes total

## Why This Matters

Most leaders waste weeks experimenting with AI tools that don't address their actual bottlenecks. This audit ensures you build AI solutions for the workflows that actually matter—the ones draining your time and energy every week.

**The businesses winning with AI aren't using more tools—they're solving the right problems.**

---

## The Process

### Step 1: Complete the Speed Round (5-10 minutes)

Answer 10 quick questions about your workflows. These questions are designed to surface the tasks that are:
- Most frequent
- Most time-consuming  
- Most frustrating

### Step 2: Use the AI Prompt (10-15 minutes)

You'll paste your answers into an AI prompt that will:
- Extract every workflow you mentioned
- Score each one using our Priority Formula: **Frustration × Time × Frequency**
- Rank them from highest to lowest priority
- Analyze your Top 3 opportunities in depth

### Step 3: Share in Community (5 minutes)

Post your Top 3 opportunities in the forum and engage with peer submissions.

## How to Answer the Speed Round

**Format:** Short, specific phrases or sentences (5-15 words per answer)

Think: *"What would I tell a colleague if they asked what's eating my time?"*

### ✅ Good Examples:

- "Preparing weekly leadership meeting agendas and action items"
- "Responding to customer contract redline requests"  
- "Building monthly performance dashboards for the executive team"
- "Researching competitive intelligence for sales proposals"

### ❌ What to Avoid:

- **Too vague:** "Meetings" or "Reports" or "Admin stuff"
  - *Why it's bad:* AI can't score what it can't understand
  
- **Too long:** Multi-sentence explanations with full context
  - *Why it's bad:* Buries the core task in narrative

- **Multiple tasks:** Listing 3-4 different things per answer
  - *Why it's bad:* Pick the most painful ONE

### Pro Tips:

- **First instinct is usually right** - don't overthink it
- **Be honest about pain** - this is for you, not your boss
- **Specific > Generic** - "Board deck creation" beats "presentations"
- **Time limit: 5-10 minutes** for all 10 questions

## What You'll Learn from This Exercise

By completing this audit, you'll discover:

✅ **Where your time actually goes** (vs. where you think it goes)

✅ **Which workflows are automation-ready** (clear inputs/outputs, repeatable logic)

✅ **Which need augmentation** (keep your judgment, eliminate grunt work)

✅ **Patterns across the cohort** (Are multiple people struggling with similar workflows? That's where we can build shared solutions.)

---

## Troubleshooting & FAQs

### Q: My AI's score for one task seems off

**A:** Reply to your AI in the same chat:

*"The score for [task name] seems [too high/low]. Here's more context: [add details about frequency/time/frustration]. Please re-score."*

Your AI will adjust based on your clarification.

---

### Q: I have more than 10 workflows I want to analyze

**A:** Start with these 10 most painful ones. After posting your Top 3, you can:
- Run the prompt again with 10 additional tasks
- Or just add them to the conversation: *"Here are 5 more workflows: [list]. Please score these too."*

---

### Q: Which AI tool should I use?

**A:** Use whichever you have access to or prefer:

- **Claude** - Tends to give the most thorough, nuanced analysis. Great for complex workflows.
- **ChatGPT** - Excellent results, slightly more concise. Good if you prefer faster responses.
- **Gemini** - Works well, especially if you're in the Google ecosystem.
- **Microsoft Copilot** - Convenient if you're already using Microsoft 365.

**All work with this prompt.** The scoring and ranking will be similar across platforms.

---

### Q: The output format doesn't exactly match what was promised

**A:** Different AI models may format results slightly differently, but all should provide:
- Scored workflows
- Ranked list
- Top 3 analysis

If something's missing, just ask: *"Can you also provide [the missing element]?"*

---

### Q: What if I don't have 10 painful workflows?

**A:** That's rare for executives, but if you truly don't have 10:
- Answer as many as you can (minimum 5)
- Think about tasks you avoid or delay (those count too)
- Consider work you WISH you had time to do (expansion opportunities)

---

### Q: Should I include workflows my team does?

**A:** For this audit, focus on **YOUR personal workflows**. 

However, if you're frequently reviewing, approving, or editing your team's work—that counts as YOUR workflow. Example: *"Reviewing and editing team's client proposals"* is a valid answer.

---

### Q: Can I use the same AI conversation to analyze additional workflows later?

**A:** Yes! Your AI maintains context within the same chat. You can add: *"Here are 3 more workflows I forgot: [list]. Please score and rank these with the others."*
