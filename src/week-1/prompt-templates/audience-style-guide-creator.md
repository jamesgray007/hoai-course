Develop a detailed, actionable audience style guide that maximizes engagement and relevance for the specified target audience.

## Required Information

To create an effective style guide, you need the following information:

<audience_context>

- **Current Challenges**: [What communication barriers exist? Why isn't your current approach working?]
- **Channel/Medium**: [Where will you communicate? Email, presentations, social media, team meetings, conferences, etc.]
</audience_context>

## Style Guide Structure

Create a comprehensive style guide with the following sections:

### 1. Audience Profile
- **Demographics**: Age, location, education, occupation, income level
- **Psychographics**: Values, beliefs, interests, lifestyle, pain points
- **Behavioral Traits**: How they consume content, decision-making patterns, preferred platforms
- **Knowledge Level**: Technical expertise, familiarity with your topic/industry
- **Motivations & Goals**: What drives them? What are they trying to achieve?

### 2. Communication Principles
- **Core Messages**: 3-5 key themes that resonate with this audience
- **Value Proposition**: Why should they listen to you? What unique perspective or value do you bring?
- **Tone Guidelines**:
  - Formal vs. Casual
  - Professional vs. Friendly
  - Authoritative vs. Collaborative
  - Serious vs. Humorous
- **Your Voice Attributes**: Choose 3-4 defining characteristics that align with your authentic leadership style (e.g., authentic, empowering, data-driven, visionary, pragmatic, supportive)
- **Leadership Presence**: How you want to be perceived (thought leader, mentor, innovator, trusted advisor, change agent, etc.)

### 3. Language Guidelines
- **Vocabulary**:
  - Words to use (terms this audience understands and respects, power words that motivate them)
  - Words to avoid (jargon that confuses, buzzwords that alienate, terms that undermine credibility)
- **Sentence Structure**:
  - Preferred length (short and punchy vs. detailed and explanatory)
  - Complexity level (simple and accessible vs. sophisticated and nuanced)
- **Grammar & Style**:
  - Active vs. Passive voice preference
  - Use of contractions (more conversational vs. more formal)
  - Person (1st person "I/we", 2nd person "you", 3rd person - which feels most authentic?)
- **Signature Phrases**: Key phrases or expressions that reinforce your leadership voice
- **Punctuation Style**: Exclamation points, em-dashes, semicolons, etc.

### 4. Content Approach
- **Format Preferences**: What formats work best? (emails, presentations, videos, written posts, live discussions, workshops, etc.)
- **Content Length**: Ideal length for different communication types with this audience
- **Storytelling Approach**: What persuades them? (data-driven vs. emotion-driven, personal stories vs. case studies, problem-solution vs. aspirational)
- **Credibility Builders**: What evidence and proof points resonate? (statistics, personal experience, research, real-world examples, expert citations)
- **Personal Elements**: How much to share about yourself (experiences, failures, opinions, vulnerability)

### 5. Engagement Strategies
- **Call-to-Action Style**: How to motivate action (direct requests vs. gentle invitations vs. inspirational challenges)
- **Relationship Building**: How to deepen connection (one-on-one interactions, acknowledgment, responsiveness)
- **Interactivity**: How to invite participation (questions, discussions, feedback requests, collaborative problem-solving)
- **Frequency & Timing**: How often to communicate, when they're most receptive
- **Authenticity Balance**: Where to be vulnerable vs. authoritative, personal vs. professional

### 6. What to Avoid
- **Content Pitfalls**: Topics or approaches that will disengage this audience or damage your credibility
- **Tone Mistakes**: Communication styles that backfire or feel inauthentic to your leadership style
- **Common Errors**: Assumptions about the audience, over/under-estimating their knowledge, being too salesy/self-promotional
- **Authenticity Traps**: Behaviors that seem forced or inconsistent with who you are

### 7. Practical Examples

Provide 3 before/after examples showing:
- **Before**: Generic or poorly-targeted communication
- **After**: Optimized communication following this style guide
- **Why It Works**: Specific elements that make the "after" version more effective

## Output Format

- **Actionable**: Provide concrete do's and don'ts, not vague suggestions
- **Specific**: Include actual word choices, phrase examples, and sample sentences
