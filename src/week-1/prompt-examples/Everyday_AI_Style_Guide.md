# Audience Style Guide — “Everyday AI for Non‑Technical Professionals”
*Built for James Gray’s brand & voice*

---

## 1. Audience Snapshot
| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Who** | Busy knowledge‑workers (marketers, project managers, ops leads, sales reps, HR partners) with little to no coding background |
| **Mindset** | Curious yet anxious about AI; want quick wins, fear sounding uninformed, crave relevance to daily tasks |
| **Goals** | • Work faster & smarter • Stay employable • Impress peers & leadership • Boost creativity |
| **Pain Points** | • Tech jargon overload • “Too many tools” paralysis • Unclear ROI • Lack of time for deep dives |
| **Motivators** | • Clear, actionable steps • Visual walkthroughs • Success stories from peers • Reassurance & empathy |

---

## 2. Brand Alignment
| Pillar / Value | Application in Content |
|----------------|------------------------|
| **Curiosity** | Open with provocative questions or surprising stats to spark exploration |
| **High‑Performance** | Emphasize measurable gains (minutes saved, leads generated) |
| **Empathy** | Acknowledge fears (“Feeling overwhelmed? You’re not alone.”) |
| **Strategic** | Tie each AI tip to a bigger business outcome—revenue, customer delight, career growth |
| **Excellence‑Driven** | Provide polished examples and “pro tips” that feel premium, not gimmicky |

---

## 3. Voice & Tone Rules
| Dimension | Guideline | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Perspective** | Second‑person (“you”) coaching voice | “You’ll trim 30 minutes off that report.” |
| **Tone** | Confident, energizing, practical; never condescending | “Let’s turn AI into your silent teammate.” |
| **Complexity** | Grade‑8 readability; replace jargon with plain‑English analogies | “A prompt is just a set of GPS directions for the model.” |
| **Sentence Length** | ≤ 20 words on average; vary rhythm for punch | |
| **Stylistic Flourishes** | • Use **bold** for key actions  <br>• Emojis sparingly (max 1 per section) to signal wins 🎯 |

---

## 4. Structural Guidelines
1. **Hook (≤ 40 words)** – Pain point or aspirational outcome.  
2. **Why It Matters (1‑2 lines)** – Connect to business/career value.  
3. **Step‑by‑Step (3‑5 bullets)** – Numbered or checkbox list.  
4. **Pro Tip / Caution** – Edge cases or common slip‑ups.  
5. **Call to Action** – Encourage immediate trial or share‑back.

---

## 5. Language & Formatting Do’s / Don’ts
| Do | Don’t |
|----|-------|
| Use analogies from everyday tools (“AI autocomplete for your brain”). | Assume prior ML knowledge |
| Show metrics (“Save ~2 hrs/week”). | Quote hazy percentages without sources |
| Embed screenshots/GIFs with teal `#008080` accents & minimalist labels | Overload slides with neon yellow blocks |
| End with one **bold takeaway** line | Bury takeaway in the middle |

---

## 6. Content Types & Cadence
| Format | Purpose | Frequency |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **1‑Minute “Win” Post (LinkedIn/Substack)** | Micro‑lesson + CTA | 3×/week |
| **Deep‑Dive Tutorial (5‑min read)** | Weekend learning | 1×/week |
| **Carousel / Infographic** | Visual summary of a workflow | 2×/month |
| **Live “Coffee Chat” Video (15 min)** | Q&A, builds trust | Monthly |

---

## 7. Reusable Storytelling Frames
1. **Problem → AI Tactic → Tangible Result**  
2. **Before / After Screenshot**  
3. **Myth Busting** – e.g., “AI will steal your job” → “Only if you ignore it.”  
4. **Mini‑Case Study** – Peer success in <150 words.

---

## 8. Sample Snippets

**Hook**  
> “Your inbox is an unruly beast. In 60 seconds, you can tame it with one AI prompt.”

**Step‑by‑Step**
1. Copy last 10 emails → paste into ChatGPT.  
2. Prompt: *“Summarize each in one sentence and flag any requiring my response today.”*  
3. Scan output, archive, act.

**Pro Tip**  
> **Avoid sensitive data.** Strip names or switch to an internal GPT if privacy is a concern.

**Call to Action**  
> **Try it now and reply with the minutes you saved.**
