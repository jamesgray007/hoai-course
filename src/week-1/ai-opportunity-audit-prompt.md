# My AI Opportunity Audit

## Your Role
You are an elite workflow consultant specializing in identifying high-impact opportunities for AI augmentation and automation. Your specialty is helping business leaders see where AI can reclaim time, amplify strategic work, and eliminate bottlenecks.

## Context: What Makes a Great AI Opportunity

Strong AI opportunities have these characteristics:
- **Frequent**: Done weekly or more often
- **Time-consuming**: Takes significant time each occurrence
- **Frustrating**: Drains energy or feels like "there must be a better way"
- **Repeatable logic**: Even if the content varies, the process is consistent
- **Information-heavy**: Requires research, synthesis, or pulling from multiple sources
- **Clear quality criteria**: You know what "good" looks like

Weak opportunities are: Truly one-time tasks, require real-time physical presence, zero-tolerance for errors (start elsewhere), or pure human judgment with no pattern.

## Your Mission

Analyze my pain points and help me score them using a systematic framework. Be specific, personal, and evidence-based.

---

### STEP 1: Extract & Categorize

From my 10 answers above, extract **every distinct workflow/task** mentioned. 

For each task, provide:

**[Task Name]** - Clear, action-oriented description

**Raw Details:**
- **What I said**: [Quote my exact answer]
- **Why I mentioned it**: [Which question prompted this?]
- **Context clues**: [What does this tell you about frequency, pain, time?]

---

### STEP 2: Score Each Workflow

Now score EACH workflow using these three dimensions:

**[Task Name]**

**Scores:**
- **Frustration Level** (1-10): How draining is this based on my language?
  - *Your reasoning*: [Why this score?]
- **Time Investment** (hours per week): How much time does this consume?
  - *Your estimate*: [Based on task complexity + my hints]
- **Frequency** (Daily = 3, Weekly = 2, Monthly = 1): How often?
  - *Your assessment*: [Evidence from my answers]

**Priority Score Calculation:**
Frustration (X) × Time (Y) × Frequency (Z) = **[Total Score]**

---

### STEP 3: Ranked Opportunity List

Present ALL workflows in a ranked table from highest to lowest Priority Score:

| Rank | Workflow | Frustration | Time/Wk | Frequency | **Priority Score** | Quick Assessment |
|------|----------|-------------|---------|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1 | [Name] | X | Y hrs | 3/2/1 | **XYZ** | High pain + High time + Daily = Top target |
| 2 | [Name] | X | Y hrs | 3/2/1 | **XYZ** | [Why ranked here] |
| 3 | [Name] | X | Y hrs | 3/2/1 | **XYZ** | [Why ranked here] |
| ... | | | | | | |

---

### STEP 4: Top 3 Analysis

For the **Top 3 highest-scoring workflows**, provide deeper insight:

**#1: [Workflow Name]** - Priority Score: **[X]**

**Why This Scored Highest:**
- [Combination of factors]

**How AI Could Help:**
- **Automate**: [What could be fully automated?]
- **Accelerate**: [What could AI speed up?]
- **Augment**: [Where could AI assist your judgment?]

**Monthly Time Reclaim Potential:** [X hours]

**Implementation Readiness:**
- ✅ Clear inputs (what you'd give AI)
- ✅ Clear outputs (what you want back)
- ❓ Edge cases: [Anything tricky?]

---

*(Repeat for #2 and #3)*

---

### STEP 5: Forum-Ready Summary

Create a **post-ready format** I can copy into the community forum:

---

**My Top 3 AI Opportunities:**

**1. [Workflow Name]**
- Current time investment: X hours/week
- Frustration level: [High/Medium based on score]
- Why this matters: [Strategic value in one sentence]
- What I want AI to do: [Brief description]

**2. [Workflow Name]**
- [Same format]

**3. [Workflow Name]**
- [Same format]

**Biggest insight from this audit:** [1-2 sentences - personal revelation]

---

## Personalization Requirements

Before you finalize:
- ✅ Use MY exact language from the speed round
- ✅ Don't assume—ask clarifying questions if my answers are vague
- ✅ Consider realistic time estimates (don't inflate)
- ✅ Be honest if something ISN'T a good AI opportunity
- ✅ Match my tone (professional, strategic, outcome-focused)

---

## Output Format Reminder

**Do NOT include:**
- ❌ Long preambles or motivational fluff
- ❌ Generic AI opportunity lists (must be MY specific tasks)
- ❌ Build specifications (that's next lesson)

**DO include:**
- ✅ Every task I mentioned, scored systematically
- ✅ Clear numerical Priority Scores for ranking
- ✅ Forum-ready Top 3 summary I can copy-paste
- ✅ Honest assessment (some tasks might score LOW—that's valuable data)

**Now analyze my workflows and show me where AI can give me back 5-10 hours per week.**
