# My AI Opportunity Analysis

## Your Role
You are an elite workflow consultant with access to our full conversation history and your memory of my work patterns. Your specialty is identifying high-impact opportunities for AI by analyzing BOTH what I explicitly say AND patterns you've observed in our interactions over time.

## Context: What Makes a Great AI Opportunity

Strong AI opportunities have these characteristics:
- **Frequent**: Done weekly or more often
- **Time-consuming**: Takes significant time each occurrence
- **Frustrating**: Drains energy or feels like "there must be a better way"
- **Repeatable logic**: Even if the content varies, the process is consistent
- **Information-heavy**: Requires research, synthesis, or pulling from multiple sources
- **Clear quality criteria**: You know what "good" looks like

## My Speed Round Answers

👉 **MY 10 PAIN POINTS:**

1. Task I do most often that makes me groan: ___
2. Thing I'm always copy-pasting: ___
3. If I had a perfect assistant, first thing I'd delegate: ___
4. Task where I think "there has to be a faster way": ___
5. Thing I do differently every time but wish I didn't: ___
6. Instructions I give AI repeatedly: ___
7. Task that requires pulling from multiple sources: ___
8. Thing I'm embarrassed how long it takes me: ___
9. Format I'm always reformatting: ___
10. Task I avoid until the last minute: ___

## Your Mission

Analyze my pain points AND our conversation history to provide three levels of insight.

---

### LEVEL 1: Validate My Manual Audit

I've already scored these workflows manually in a spreadsheet using:
**Priority Score = Frustration × Time × Frequency**

Review my 10 answers and:

**For each workflow mentioned:**

1. **Extract the workflow** - What's the actual task?
2. **Estimate scores** - What would YOU score for Frustration (1-10), Time (hrs/week), Frequency (3/2/1)?
3. **Calculate YOUR Priority Score** - Frustration × Time × Frequency
4. **Compare insight** - Do you agree with what I might have scored? Why or why not?

**Present as a table:**

| Workflow | Your Frustration Est. | Your Time Est. | Your Frequency | **Your Priority Score** | Why This Score |
|----------|----------------------|----------------|----------------|------------------------|----------------|
| [Name] | X | Y hrs | 3/2/1 | **XYZ** | [Reasoning] |

---

### LEVEL 2: Hidden Patterns from Our History

**Search our conversation history and your memory of me.** 

Find **2-3 tasks I've asked you to help with MULTIPLE times** that I didn't explicitly mention in the Speed Round but are clearly repetitive workflows.

For each hidden pattern:

**[Workflow Name]**

- **The Pattern You Spotted**: [What keeps coming up in our conversations?]
- **Evidence**: [Quote 2-3 examples of when I asked for this - with dates if possible]
- **Why I Didn't Mention It**: [What blind spot am I in? Do I not realize it's repetitive?]
- **Your Estimated Priority Score**: [Calculate: Frustration × Time × Frequency based on our history]
- **The Unlock**: [How would systematizing this change my work?]

---

### LEVEL 3: Strategic Opportunities from Memory

Based on **everything you know about my role, work patterns, and goals** from our conversation history and your memory:

Identify **2-3 workflows I SHOULD be systematizing** but either:
- I'm avoiding because they're hard
- I don't do consistently (but should)
- I haven't recognized as systematizable

For each strategic opportunity:

**[Workflow Name]**

- **The Gap**: [What am I not doing that I should be?]
- **Why I'm Not Doing It**: [What's the barrier? Time? Complexity? Unclear how?]
- **Evidence from Our History**: [When have I mentioned this pain or goal?]
- **The Unlock**: [How would this transform my work?]
- **Build Complexity**: [Easy/Medium/Hard to implement]

---

### CONSOLIDATED ANALYSIS

**Master Ranking Table:**

Combine ALL workflows (from Speed Round + Hidden Patterns + Strategic Opportunities) into one ranked list:

| Rank | Workflow | Source | Priority Score | Monthly Hours | Build Ease | Why This Rank |
|------|----------|--------|----------------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| 1 | [Name] | Speed Round | **X** | Y hrs | Easy/Med/Hard | [Reasoning] |
| 2 | [Name] | Hidden Pattern | **X** | Y hrs | Easy/Med/Hard | [Reasoning] |
| 3 | [Name] | Strategic | **X** | Y hrs | Easy/Med/Hard | [Reasoning] |
| ... | | | | | | |

### TOP 3 DEEP DIVE

For the **Top 3 highest-priority workflows** (from any source), provide:

**#1: [Workflow Name]** - Priority Score: **[X]** - Source: [Speed Round/Hidden/Strategic]

**Why This Scored Highest:**
- [Combination of factors - use our history as evidence]

**How AI Could Help:**
- **Automate**: [What could be fully automated?]
- **Accelerate**: [What could AI speed up significantly?]
- **Augment**: [Where should AI assist but you retain judgment?]

**Monthly Time Reclaim Potential:** [X hours - be realistic]

**Implementation Readiness:**
- ✅ Clear inputs: [What I'd provide AI based on our history]
- ✅ Clear outputs: [What I want back]
- ⚠️ Edge cases: [What might be tricky based on what you know about my work?]

**Next Steps:** [Concrete first action I should take]

*(Repeat for #2 and #3)*

### COMPARISON WITH MY MANUAL AUDIT

**Where We Agree:**
- [Which workflows did we both identify as high priority?]

**Where We Disagree:**
- [Which workflows did I score higher/lower than you would? Why?]
- [Which workflows did I miss entirely that you found in our history?]

**Blind Spots I Should Consider:**
- [What patterns am I not seeing?]
- [What am I avoiding that would have high ROI?]

### FORUM-READY SUMMARY

Create a post I can copy directly into the community forum:

---

**My Top 3 AI Opportunities:**

**1. [Workflow Name]**
- Current time investment: X hours/week
- Priority Score: X (validated by AI analysis)
- Why this matters: [Strategic value in one sentence]
- What I want AI to do: [Specific capability]

**2. [Workflow Name]**
- Current time investment: X hours/week
- Priority Score: X
- Why this matters: [One sentence]
- What I want AI to do: [Specific capability]

**3. [Workflow Name]**
- Current time investment: X hours/week
- Priority Score: X
- Why this matters: [One sentence]
- What I want AI to do: [Specific capability]

**Biggest insight from this audit:** [1-2 sentences about what the AI analysis revealed that I didn't see in my manual scoring - include any surprises from conversation history analysis]

## Critical Instructions

**You MUST:**
- ✅ Actually search our conversation history - don't just analyze the 10 answers
- ✅ Reference your memory of my role, goals, and work patterns
- ✅ Quote specific examples from our past conversations when identifying hidden patterns
- ✅ Be honest if you disagree with a priority - explain your reasoning
- ✅ Identify workflows I'm avoiding or not doing consistently
- ✅ Use my actual language and communication style

**You must NOT:**
- ❌ Only analyze the 10 Speed Round answers (that's just Level 1)
- ❌ Make generic suggestions that could apply to anyone
- ❌ Ignore patterns from our conversation history
- ❌ Be overly cautious - challenge my thinking if you see blind spots

**Now analyze my workflows using ALL available context - Speed Round answers, conversation history, and your memory of my work.**
