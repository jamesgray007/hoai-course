# My AI Opportunity Audit

## Your Role
You are an elite workflow consultant specializing in identifying high-impact opportunities for AI augmentation and automation. Your specialty is helping business leaders see where AI can reclaim time, amplify strategic work, and eliminate bottlenecks.

## Context: What Makes a Great AI Opportunity

Strong AI opportunities have these characteristics:
- **Frequent**: Done weekly or more often
- **Time-consuming**: Takes significant time each occurrence
- **Frustrating**: Drains energy or feels like "there must be a better way"
- **Repeatable logic**: Even if the content varies, the process is consistent
- **Information-heavy**: Requires research, synthesis, or pulling from multiple sources
- **Clear quality criteria**: You know what "good" looks like

## My Speed Round Answers

**INSTRUCTIONS:** For each question below, provide FOUR pieces of information:

1. **Workflow**: Short, specific description (5-15 words)
2. **Frequency**: Type "Daily" OR "Weekly" OR "Monthly"
3. **Time**: Hours per week (realistic estimate)
4. **Frustration**: Number from 1-10 (1=mild annoyance, 10=excruciating)

**Example format:**
```
Workflow: Writing weekly board status updates
Frequency: Weekly
Time: 4 hours
Frustration: 8
```

## Your Mission

Analyze my workflows using the Priority Score formula and provide systematic insights.

---

### STEP 1: Calculate Priority Scores

Convert my responses to numerical scores and calculate priorities:

**Frequency Conversion:**
- Daily = 3
- Weekly = 2
- Monthly = 1

**Priority Score Formula:**
Frustration × Time/Week × Frequency = Priority Score

**Create a table:**

| # | Workflow | Frustration | Time/Wk | Frequency | **Priority Score** | Monthly Hours |
|---|----------|-------------|---------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| 1 | [Name] | X | Y | 3/2/1 | **X×Y×F** | Time×4 |
| 2 | [Name] | X | Y | 3/2/1 | **X×Y×F** | Time×4 |
| ... | | | | | | |

---

### STEP 2: Ranked Opportunity List

Present ALL workflows sorted by Priority Score (highest to lowest):

| Rank | Workflow | Priority Score | Frustration | Time/Wk | Frequency | Monthly Hours | Why This Score |
|------|----------|----------------|-------------|---------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | [Name] | **XXX** | X | Y | 3/2/1 | Z | [Reasoning] |
| 2 | [Name] | **XXX** | X | Y | 3/2/1 | Z | [Reasoning] |
| 3 | [Name] | **XXX** | X | Y | 3/2/1 | Z | [Reasoning] |
| ... | | | | | | | |

### STEP 3: Hidden Patterns from Memory

**Search our conversation history and your memory of me.**

Find **2-3 tasks I've asked you to help with MULTIPLE times** that I didn't mention in the Speed Round but are clearly repetitive workflows.

For each hidden pattern:

**[Workflow Name]**

- **The Pattern You Spotted**: [What keeps coming up in our conversations?]
- **Evidence**: [Quote 2-3 examples of when I asked for this]
- **Your Estimated Scores**:
  - Frustration: X/10
  - Time: Y hrs/week
  - Frequency: 3/2/1
  - **Priority Score: X×Y×F**
- **Why I Didn't Mention It**: [What blind spot am I in?]
- **The Unlock**: [How would systematizing this change my work?]

---

### STEP 4: Top 3 Deep Dive

For the **Top 3 highest-scoring workflows** (from Speed Round or Hidden Patterns), provide:

**#1: [Workflow Name]** - Priority Score: **[X]**

**Why This Scored Highest:**
- [Combination of factors - show the math]

**How AI Could Help:**
- **Automate**: [What could be fully automated?]
- **Accelerate**: [What could AI speed up significantly?]
- **Augment**: [Where should AI assist but you retain judgment?]

**Monthly Time Reclaim Potential:** [X hours - based on your time estimate × 4]

**Implementation Readiness:**
- ✅ Clear inputs: [What you'd provide AI]
- ✅ Clear outputs: [What you want back]
- ⚠️ Edge cases: [Anything tricky?]

**Next Steps:** [Concrete first action]

*(Repeat for #2 and #3)*

### STEP 5: Forum-Ready Summary

Create a post I can copy directly into the community forum:

---

**My Top 3 AI Opportunities:**

**1. [Workflow Name]**
- Current time investment: X hours/week
- Priority Score: XXX (Frustration: X, Time: Y, Frequency: Z)
- Why this matters: [Strategic value in one sentence]
- What I want AI to do: [Specific capability - automate/accelerate/augment]

**2. [Workflow Name]**
- Current time investment: X hours/week
- Priority Score: XXX
- Why this matters: [One sentence]
- What I want AI to do: [Specific capability]

**3. [Workflow Name]**
- Current time investment: X hours/week
- Priority Score: XXX
- Why this matters: [One sentence]
- What I want AI to do: [Specific capability]

**Biggest insight from this audit:** [1-2 sentences - What surprised you about the scores? What pattern emerged from conversation history that you hadn't labeled as a "workflow"?]

## Scoring Reference Guide

**Frustration Scale (1-10):**
- **1-3**: Mild annoyance (eye roll, but manageable)
- **4-6**: Moderately draining (affects your mood, energy sink)
- **7-9**: Significantly frustrating (makes you procrastinate, dreading it)
- **10**: Excruciating (makes you question your career choices)

**Time Per Week:**
- Include ALL time: prep, execution, cleanup, revisions
- Be honest, not aspirational
- Round to nearest hour or half-hour

**Frequency:**
- **Daily**: 5+ times per week
- **Weekly**: 1-4 times per week
- **Monthly**: Less than weekly but you do it regularly

---

## Critical Instructions

**You MUST:**
- ✅ Use the EXACT numbers I provided (don't adjust my scores)
- ✅ Calculate Priority Scores accurately using the formula
- ✅ Search conversation history for hidden patterns I missed
- ✅ Reference your memory of my role, goals, and work patterns
- ✅ Show your math in the rankings (transparency)
- ✅ Be honest if a workflow scored lower than I might expect

**You must NOT:**
- ❌ Estimate or guess my scores (I provided them)
- ❌ Only analyze the 10 Speed Round answers (also search history)
- ❌ Make generic suggestions that could apply to anyone
- ❌ Ignore patterns from our conversation history

**Now analyze my workflows using my actual scores and ALL available context from our conversation history.**
