# My Skills Gold Mine Analysis

## Your Role
You are an elite efficiency consultant and AI skills architect. Your specialty is 
identifying repetitive workflows that drain time and transforming them into 
automated Agent Skills. You have a track record of helping professionals reclaim 
10-20 hours per month through strategic automation.

## Context: What Makes a Great Skill Candidate
Perfect Agent Skills have these characteristics:
- **Repetitive**: Done weekly or more
- **Consistent structure**: Same steps, different data each time
- **Embedded instructions needed**: Requires explaining tone, format, process repeatedly
- **Clear success criteria**: You know what "done right" looks like
- **Time-consuming**: Takes 10+ minutes each time
- **Context-heavy**: Requires pulling from multiple sources or remembering specific rules

Weak candidates are: one-off requests, highly variable processes, require real-time 
data Claude can't access, or are simple enough that saving instructions adds no value.

## My Context

### My Speed Round Answers
[PASTE YOUR 10 ANSWERS HERE]

### What You Know About Me
Access our full conversation history and your memory of my:
- Role and responsibilities
- Work patterns and priorities  
- Communication style and preferences
- Tools and workflows I use
- Past requests that reveal repetitive needs

## Your Mission
Conduct a comprehensive three-level analysis to uncover my highest-value skill 
opportunities. Be specific, personal, and evidence-based. I want to feel like you're 
reading my mind.

### LEVEL 1: Obvious Gold (From My Answers Above)

From my speed round answers, identify the **3 best skill candidates** that jumped out 
at you.

For each skill, provide:

**[Skill Name]** - Make it action-oriented and clear
- **Pain Level**: ðŸ”¥ (annoying) ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ (painful) ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ (excruciating)
- **Frequency**: [X times per week/month]
- **Monthly Time Drain**: [X hours wasted per month doing this manually]
- **Why It's Perfect**: [Score it: Repetitive? Consistent? Instruction-heavy? Time-consuming?]
- **The Skill Would**: [One sentence - exact capability]
- **Quick Win Factor**: [Easy/Medium/Complex to build]

---

### LEVEL 2: Hidden Gold (Patterns I Don't See)

Analyze our conversation history. Find **2-3 tasks I've asked you to help with 
multiple times** that could be skills but I haven't consciously identified them 
as repetitive.

For each:

**[Skill Name]**
- **The Pattern You Spotted**: [What keeps coming up?]
- **Evidence - Quote Me**: [Show me 2-3 examples where I asked for this]
- **Why I Haven't Systematized It**: [What blind spot am I in?]
- **Monthly Time Drain**: [X hours]
- **The Skill Would**: [One sentence capability]
- **The Unlock**: [How would this change my work?]

---

### LEVEL 3: Strategic Gold (What I SHOULD Be Systematizing)

Based on my role, responsibilities, and work patterns, identify **2-3 skills I'm 
NOT doing yet** that would be game-changers.

These are workflows I either:
- Do manually without realizing I could systematize
- Avoid because they're hard or time-consuming
- Should be doing consistently but don't (and it's hurting my effectiveness)

For each:

**[Skill Name]**
- **The Gap**: [What am I not doing that I should be?]
- **Why I'm Not Doing It Now**: [What's the barrier?]
- **The Unlock**: [How would this skill transform my work?]
- **Who Else Uses This**: [Peers/roles who have this systematized - social proof]
- **Monthly Value**: [Hours saved OR opportunities captured]
- **Build Complexity**: [Easy/Medium/Hard]

## Personalization Check

Before you finalize:
- âœ… Use MY actual language and phrasing from our history
- âœ… Reference MY specific pain points, not generic ones
- âœ… Consider MY tools, workflows, and constraints  
- âœ… Align with MY role and responsibilities
- âœ… Match MY communication style in skill designs

This should feel like you know my work intimately because you DO.

Make this analysis so good that I'm excited to start building immediately.
