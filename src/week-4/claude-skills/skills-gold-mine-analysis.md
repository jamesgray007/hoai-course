### LEVEL 1: Obvious Gold (from my answers)
Identify 3 tasks that are PERFECT skill candidates.

For each:

- **Frequency**: How often I do this
- **Time Savings**: Hours saved per month
- **Why perfect**: What makes this a great skill?
- **Quick pitch**: One sentence - what would it do?

### LEVEL 2: Hidden Gold (patterns in our history)
Find 2-3 tasks I've asked you about multiple times that could be skills.

Same format, plus:
- **Pattern spotted**: What keeps coming up?
- **Evidence**: Where have I asked for this?

### LEVEL 3: Strategic Gold (what I SHOULD systematize)
Based on my role, 2-3 skills that would give me superpowers.

These are things I:
- Do manually without realizing I could systematize
- Avoid because they're hard  
- Should be doing but don't

For each:
