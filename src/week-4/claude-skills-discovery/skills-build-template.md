---

### Test 2: Edge Case
Use messy/incomplete/weird data. Does it handle it gracefully?

**Test input:**  
[Paste what you're testing with]


**Result**: ‚úÖ Worked / ‚ùå Failed / ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs adjustment


**Notes:**


---

### Test 3: Real World
Use it for an actual task. Is the output actually useful?

**Test input:**  
[Paste what you're testing with]


**Result**: ‚úÖ Worked / ‚ùå Failed / ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs adjustment


**Notes:**


---

## STEP 4: Iterate (5 minutes)

Based on your tests, what needs adjustment?

### Changes to Make

**Issue 1:**
- **Problem**: [What didn't work]
- **Fix**: [What instruction to add/change]
- **Updated**: ‚úÖ / ‚è≥

**Issue 2:**
- **Problem**: [What didn't work]
- **Fix**: [What instruction to add/change]
- **Updated**: ‚úÖ / ‚è≥

**Issue 3:**
- **Problem**: [What didn't work]
- **Fix**: [What instruction to add/change]
- **Updated**: ‚úÖ / ‚è≥

## STEP 5: Document & Share (2 minutes)

### Quick Stats
- **Time to build**: ___ minutes
- **Time to use it**: ___ minutes (vs. ___ minutes doing it manually)
- **Time savings**: ___ minutes per use
- **Frequency**: ___ times per week/month
- **Monthly time savings**: ___ hours

### Share Your Win
Post in Slack/community:
```
‚úÖ Built: [Skill Name]
üéØ It does: [One sentence]
‚è±Ô∏è Time to build: X minutes
üí∞ Saves me: X hours per month
üî• Best part: [What surprised you or what you love about it]
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### "My skill gives inconsistent outputs"
**Fix**: Add more specific format requirements. Show an example output in your instructions.

### "It's not following my tone/voice"
**Fix**: Be MORE specific. Instead of "professional," say "professional but conversational, like I'm explaining to a colleague, avoid jargon."

### "It includes stuff I don't want"
**Fix**: Add to your "Never" list. Be explicit: "Never include preambles like 'Here is...' or 'I've analyzed...'"

### "It misses important context"
**Fix**: Add to your "Always" list. Example: "Always consider the audience is non-technical executives."

### "Output is too long/short"
**Fix**: Specify length. "Maximum 3 paragraphs" or "Between 500-750 words" or "Exactly 5 bullet points."

### "It doesn't handle edge cases well"
**Fix**: Add specific instructions for those cases. "If no deadline is mentioned, suggest 'This week' for urgent items, 'Next meeting' for others."

## Template Complete! 

### Next Steps:
1. ‚úÖ Build this skill in Claude
2. ‚úÖ Test it 3 times
3. ‚úÖ Use it for real work
4. ‚úÖ Share your win
5. ‚úÖ Build your next skill

### Remember:

---

**Pro tip**: After you use a skill 5 times, review it. Is there anything that consistently needs manual adjustment? That's your next iteration opportunity.
