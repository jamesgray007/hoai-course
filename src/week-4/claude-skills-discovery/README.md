## Tips for Best Results

1. ✅ **Be specific** in the Speed Round - concrete examples beat vague descriptions
2. ✅ **Use real pain** - what actually frustrates you, not what "should" be automated
3. ✅ **Trust the patterns** - Claude spots repetition you don't consciously see
4. ✅ **Start small** - build your Quick Win first, not your most ambitious skill
5. ✅ **Test immediately** - never trust a skill until you've tested it with real data
6. ✅ **Iterate quickly** - v1.0 → test → v1.1 → test. That's how great skills are made.
