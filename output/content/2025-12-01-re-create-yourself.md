## 📘 LINKEDIN POST

Most people spend their careers being defined by others.

Their job title. Their industry. Their "background."

Robert Greene calls this the trap of accepting roles society foists on you.

The alternative? Re-create yourself.

Not in a fake way. In an intentional way.

Here's what I've learned about identity:

→ You don't have to be the person your resume says you are
→ Your past experience doesn't dictate your future positioning
→ The story you tell about yourself shapes how others see you

The most compelling people I know didn't wait for permission to become who they wanted to be.

They decided who they were becoming. Then they acted like it until the world caught up.

This isn't about deception. It's about authorship.

You can let your identity be a collection of accidents—where you went to school, what job you fell into, what others expected of you.

Or you can be the architect of your own narrative.

The difference between forgettable and unforgettable professionals?

Intentionality.

What story are you telling about yourself—and who wrote it?

**Format**: Thread

1/ Most people's identity is an accident.

A collection of job titles, expectations, and roles others assigned them.

Robert Greene's Law 25 offers an alternative:

Re-create yourself. Here's what that actually means:

2/ Society assigns you roles constantly:

"You're a finance person"
"You're too junior for that"
"That's not your lane"

Most people accept these definitions without question.

The powerful ones reject them.

3/ Re-creating yourself isn't about being fake.

It's about being intentional.

Who do you want to become?
What story do you want to tell?
What image do you want to project?

Most people never ask these questions.

4/ Greene's insight: Be the master of your own image.

Don't let others define it for you.

The alternative is letting your identity be shaped by:
- Your resume
- Other people's expectations
- Where you happened to start

That's not a strategy. That's an accident.

5/ The most magnetic people I've met share one trait:

They decided who they were becoming before anyone else did.

Then they acted like it until the world caught up.

6/ This doesn't mean being inauthentic.

It means being the author of your own narrative.

You can be a collection of accidents.

Or you can be intentional about your identity.

Which sounds more powerful?

7/ The question to ask yourself:

"Who is defining my identity right now—me or everyone else?"

If the answer isn't you, it might be time to re-create yourself.

## 📧 SUBSTACK TEASER

**Subject Line**: Who wrote your identity?

I've been thinking about a question that makes me uncomfortable.

Who decided who I am?

Not philosophically. Practically. Who wrote the story I tell about myself at dinner parties, in job interviews, in my own head?

Robert Greene has this provocative law in *The 48 Laws of Power*: "Re-create yourself."

His argument is simple but unsettling: Most of us accept the roles that society assigns us. We become "the finance person" or "the creative type" or "the one who's good at operations but not strategy." We let our identity be a collection of accidents—where we went to school, what job we fell into, what others expected.

But there's another option.

You can be the architect of your own narrative.

This isn't about being fake. The most authentic people I know are also the most intentional about how they present themselves. They didn't wait for the world to tell them who they were. They decided. Then they acted like it until reality caught up.

In this week's essay, I want to explore what it actually looks like to "re-create yourself"—not in a cheesy personal-branding way, but in a way that gives you genuine agency over your own story.

Because here's the uncomfortable truth: if you're not actively writing your identity, someone else is.

## 📊 STRATEGY BRIEF

**Recommended Posting Times**:
- LinkedIn: Tuesday or Wednesday, 8-9am (professional audience at start of workday, primed for career reflection)
- X: Wednesday, 12-1pm EST (midday engagement, thread format works well for lunch scroll)
- Substack: Thursday morning (gives time to develop into full essay, lands before weekend reading time)

**Hashtags**:
- LinkedIn: #personalbrand #leadership #careeradvice #professionaldevelopment #selfawareness
- X: None (thread is strong enough without them; hashtags can feel try-hard on X)

**Cross-Promotion Sequence**:
1. **Day 1 (Tuesday)**: Post LinkedIn version — establishes the concept, drives professional engagement
2. **Day 2 (Wednesday)**: Post X thread — reaches different audience, more conversational format
3. **Day 3 (Thursday)**: Send Substack — goes deeper for subscribers, can reference LinkedIn/X engagement ("This sparked a lot of conversation this week...")
4. **Day 4-5**: Share best comments/replies from LinkedIn and X as follow-up content

**Engagement Prompts**:
- "What story are you telling about yourself—and who wrote it?"
- "When's the last time you intentionally changed how you position yourself?"
- "What role has society assigned you that you've been meaning to reject?"
